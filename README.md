We have a large database of contacts, we are looking for a way to efficiently search and filter on all available fields ( The fields available might change later ). The backend was developed to allow a lot of custom filters and ranges. Find a way that allows our users to easily and efficiently search and filter. We are also contemplating the idea of allowing the saving of custom searches / filters.

What will we be looking for:

- The current implementation can be seen as a rather poor state of events, there are no tests, and there is no meaningful structure. In a final implementation, I will look for reusability, structure and high-quality code.

- The design you choose has to make sense, if you are interested you can send us your ideas before you start implementing anything.

- We will not be looking at the backend ( server ) you can leave this as is or add more endpoints as you see fit.

Do not add more libraries ( if you feel like another library is necessary ask beforehand ).

```js
npm run dev:server
npm run dev:app
```

I would love to have had more time to clean this up and make it more clear, but you will have to live with what you got :-). Have fun!
